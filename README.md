### Introduction
The code that follows was created by me earlier this semester (Spring 2020).
It prints out a maze on screen that the user must navigate through to reach the finish line.

### How to Install
**Requirements**  
* Eclipse

**Installation steps**  
1. Download the [zip](https://github.com/c9victor/c9victor.github.io/blob/master/Info/Lab04.zip).  
2. Extract the files.  
3. Open Eclipse > File > Open Projects From File System  
4. Click directory and navigate to the folder in which you saved the extracted files.  
5. Click finish

The folder should now appear in your package explorer as shown:
!["Package Explorer"](https://github.com/c9victor/c9victor.github.io/blob/master/Info/Package%20Explorer.PNG)

6. Run the program as a java application to play the game.  
7. Run Maze Game > Solution

### Usage
#### Symbols
* X: represents a wall. Users cannot navigate through walls.
* S: start position.
* @: user's current position.
* G: end goal.
* .: shows the user where they have traveled.  
User enters "up", "down", "left", or "right" to navigate the maze.  
Navigate to G to win the game.

### Troubleshooting
If you can not extract the files you may need to download a program such as [WinRaR](https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm).
